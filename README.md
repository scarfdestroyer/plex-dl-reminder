Plex Reminders aims to aid users of plex with managing new episodes of TV shows.

The end goal is to log into plex and be able to see which shows have new seasons/episodes out.

If you have the entirety of a finished show like Seinfeld it will do nothing but if that new episode of Rick and Morty is out it will show that series as incomplete and list any missing episodes.

The plex part of this project shouldn't be too difficult but im unsure of how robust the tv database's API is. I suppose I will find out.
